<p class="text">  <span class="hello"> "Hello World" </span>, the universal language of developers is often seen as a freindly reminder that you will be okay as a software developer. My journey  in the tech space broke out as a result of my default interest to study things and patterns. A desire to create unique patterns and structures using technology is what keeps me going. <br> <br>   <span class="hello"> "Hello World" </span>    became my starting point to a world of endless possibilities where creativity meets logic, allowing you to build solutions that can shape industries and improve lives. The learning process can be intense, as you constantly face new technologies, solve complex problems, and debug frustrating errors. Yet, there’s immense satisfaction in seeing your code come to life, whether it's a simple webpage or a robust application. The field demands perseverance, adaptability, and a passion for continuous learning, but it also offers the thrill of innovation and the promise of a fulfilling career in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. In the journey of software Developement  developers are left to deal with a <span class="hello">  hello world </span> of scary <span class="r"> " what if's ? " </span> not because we don't belive in the process even though it can be daunting but because along the line we will be faced with challenges that we can't see (i.e the error in your console that tells you err in line 1 but you check to see that line one is empty) or  the bug that AI cant help you solve or burnt out from too much mental stress , the list goes on to the point that it looks like an  etc(&#9854;); ,  if it was a real code. It's also very reasonable to say , " challenges would gravitate to you because you have the solution" but in this field, it is believed by the sassy project manager that solutions to those challenges that happen can come at the speed of light. <br> This is  actually a post made for that guy that is looking for a motivational writeup written by a developer in which in reality, might only know how to print <span class="hello"> "hello world" </span> on his/her console. <br> As developers, we often find ourselves deep in thought concern to be better at our craft, but in truth we remain part of the unique 1% who have made life significantly easier for others. To continue improving lives, we must first appreciate ourselves and the incredible opportunity we have to write <span class="hello">CLEAN, DIRTY, BEST PRACTICE OR SPAGHETTI CODE</span>.. So you might be a dveloper somewhere in this world reading this technical blog post and you might be wondering and saying to yourself that I should start blogging my own stuff,planet earth remains a free world and you can do it. after all who I am to tell you what language you should print <span class="hello"> "Hello World" </span> in.  </p>
